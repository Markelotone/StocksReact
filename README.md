Stock Page in React, assignment 1

This was an assignment for one of my units where I had to develop a Web App.
It's a simple two tab web app, firstly you can search by stock name or industry, once clicked you can change the range of dates in which you would like to
view the information. 
There is also a line graph on the bottom to display that information to the user. 

The API can only be used if you are connected to the uni's VPN

Any help with the filtering of the data in the Stocks.jsx page would be much appreciated in order to make it cleaner. 

THANK YOU
